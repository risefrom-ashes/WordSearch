After the flood, the terrible reckoning: this week it emerged that one of the most ancient churches of Venice, containing the city’s earliest remaining mosaics, had been hit by the tides that overwhelmed the city during the past week. The Byzantine Santa Maria Assunta Basilica, dating to 639, was inundated three times. Half of Venice’s 120 or so churches are thought to have suffered damage. The flood waters affected 85% of the city, causing devastation to the shops, businesses and homes of Venetians who struggle to preserve one of humanity’s most beautiful achievements as a living city.

Those residents have been grievously let down. Some disasters are unforseeable. This one was all too predictable. Tides high enough to flood Venice were once exceptional events, but, of the 10 highest tides in its history, half have occurred during the course of the last 20 years. The world’s seas are rising, due to the climate crisis, and Venice has anyway been sinking, by around 1mm a year, into the soft terrain on which its foundations were built.

Given this ominous context, the failure to complete a flood barrier project launched in 2003, which is now running 10 years behind schedule, shames the successive Italian governments that have overseen the plan. A corruption scandal, cost overruns and muddled management mean it will not be in place until 2022 at the earliest. The inadequacy of the regional Veneto council, controlled by Matteo Salvini’s League, was vividly captured by its rejection of measures to tackle the climate crisis last week – a decision taken minutes before its chambers on Venice’s Grand Canal were filled with saltwater. But the inquest into this disaster should have a remit that goes beyond flood prevention. The world has loved Venice without caring for it. The Piazza San Marco Association has observed that the city had become so depopulated that it would be difficult to find the electricians, plumbers and carpenters needed to repair the damage. Venice, it said in a statement, “was moving ever closer to a real and irrevocable end”.

Numerous properties are rented out to visitors through Airbnb, further hollowing out the centre and rendering its labyrinthine streets all but impassable for much of the year. There has been much talk about solutions, but little meaningful action. On 1 December a consultative referendum will be held on whether to separate the administration of Venice from the mainland town of Mestre. The desirability of such a separation is moot, given the level of economic interdependency; that it is being contemplated at all indicates the current level of despair. A mission from the Unesco World Heritage Centre is due to make an advisory visit to Venice early next year. In the wake of last week’s events, that trip should now become a catalyst for action, with international assistance, to save the city for generations to come. This is a debt owed by the present to the past as well as the future.

This article was amended on 26 November 2019 because an earlier version said that the 10 highest tides in the history of Venice occurred during the course of the last 20 years. In fact, of the 10 highest tides in its history, half have occurred in the past two decades.

… the Guardian will not stay quiet. This is our pledge: we will continue to give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand. The Guardian recognises the climate emergency as the defining issue of our times.

We made a choice: to keep Guardian journalism open to all. We do not have a paywall because we believe everyone deserves access to factual information, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.

Our independence means we are free to investigate and challenge inaction by those in power. We will inform our readers about threats to the environment based on scientific facts, not driven by commercial or political interests. And we have made several important changes to our style guide to ensure the language we use accurately reflects the environmental catastrophe.

The Guardian believes that the problems we face on the climate crisis are systemic and that fundamental societal change is needed. We will keep reporting on the efforts of individuals and communities around the world who are fearlessly taking a stand for future generations and the preservation of human life on earth. We want their stories to inspire hope. We will also report back on our own progress as an organisation, as we take important steps to address our impact on the environment.

We hope you will consider supporting the Guardian’s open, independent reporting today. Every contribution from our readers, however big or small, is so valuable. Support The Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.

I assure you, most of us Venetians would not “whinge” at the loss of money from cruise ships, there is a large and growing movement to stop the ships. And there was plenty of money coming in from tourism before the cruise ships started. MOSE has been a disaster, but if the project was finished it could provide some temporary relief from the worst floods, whilst other, more long term projects are pursued.One thing the local Council could do immed…The great cultural heritage of a millennium, replete with architectural masterpieces of unique value from at least 6 masters of repute and many lesser works of great value are all at risk of gradual inundation.As the land is low-lying and cannot be readily raised, it is hard to see some clear way of saving the city other than by destroying its character, and that only through a massive alteration that is not even clearly possible or desirable.
